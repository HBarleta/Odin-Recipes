  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Cooking the perfect sunny side up egg is quite easy. There is only 3 ingredients necessary and one very hot pan preferrably a cast iron.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil or preferred cooking oil</li>
        <li>Whole raw egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper for taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The cooking method is very simple. Heat the cast iron pan until it is smoking.</li> 
        <li>Carefully crack your raw egg and let the contents fall into the pan without spilling the oil.</li>
        <li>The key to having perfect fried eggs is to not move or touch the egg until the outer edges are browned. This creates a layer of crispy goodness allowing you to flip the egg (optional) for hard side up.</li>
        <li>After several minutes of cooking; the egg should move freely without sticking to the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
